// launch (docs/plans/ide-desktop-launch-plan-2026-09-03.md T2). It is the ONLY

// resolution lives in internal/toolresolve, argv/env composition in
// internal/guilaunch, identity + authorization in internal/termsvc, and the
// wire shape in internal/intelligence/dashboard. This file joins them.
//
// It is the GUI sibling of ptyLauncher (terminal_launch.go) and follows the
// same discipline: the argv is server-derived in full, the child environment is
// the daemon's own minus the internal OOB/marker variables, and the per-launch
// audit line records variable NAMES and counts only — never a value.

// so a launch performs no config discovery of its own.
