// older sibling / route-drift State() and the capture checks.

// unroutedSurfaceTools is the CLOSED tool half of the UnroutedSurfaces
// vocabulary: the registry tools that declare per-surface route facts
// (integration Capability.RouteSurfaces), the only ones whose surfaces the
// node can judge as an observed bypass. It lives here, not in the
// integration registry, for the same reason as driftedToolLabels: the org
// server validates against the wire vocabulary without linking the node's
// registry. routeattest.TestRouteSurfaceToolsAreWireLabels fails when a
// registry tool gains route surfaces this table does not name.
//
// Adding a row is safe in both directions: NormalizeLabels runs on both
// sides, so an older server drops a label it does not know and an older node
// never sends one.
