// commit-pr-merge-tracking-plan-2026-10-15.md section 12.3): the closed
// vocabularies and the plain row shapes every other delivery package passes
// around. internal/store/delivery.go persists these shapes,
// internal/landingscan and internal/deliverysvc produce them,
// internal/deliverynet returns provider payloads already normalised into
// them, and the dashboard composes them. This package is PURE (no sql, net,
// http, os/exec, fsnotify; pinned by imports_test.go).
