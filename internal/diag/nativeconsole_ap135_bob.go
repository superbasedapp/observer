// EnforcedHooks carrying Observer's Bob hooks on an org-managed node (with
// the per-node registration standing down), and EnableTelemetry. The hook
// package owns the reading and the coverage rule (internal/hook/
// ibmbob_policy.go); these notes only report what it decides, so the doctor
// and `observer init` cannot disagree.

// checkIBMBobTeamsPolicy is ibm-bob-teams on Windows and macOS, where the
// policy lives in the registry (HKLM) or a managed-preferences plist. dom is
// what Bob's macOS preferences domains (FU-105), or its Windows HKLM and
// HKCU policy keys (FU-115), carry by key name: a key the user's own domain
// or the per-user HKCU key sets is reported as user-set, never as
// administrator policy, and never changes the stand-down reading above it.
