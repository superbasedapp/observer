// disclosure.go is the online checks' first-run disclosure (security plan
// section 8.3 "Disclosure text"; D-759, D-764 Q23): shown once on every
// node when online checks first become active, which on the developer and
// full distros is first run, and kept on the Package checks card of the
// Code security page. No online query is sent before it has been shown
// (plans decision log P-011: a config with no [components] block resolves
// every compiled module active, so the disclosure, not the component
// state, is what stands between a fresh install and its first query).

// DisclosureVersion is bumped when the text changes materially; a node
// that saw an older version is shown the new one before its next query.
// Version 2 (lane sec-d1fix) names superbased.app and the control that
// exists.
const DisclosureVersion = 2

// DisclosureText is the individual-node text.
const DisclosureText = "Observer checks packages your AI agent tries to install, and the packages your projects use, " +
	"against public vulnerability and malware databases, so it can warn you about bad packages with the latest data. " +
	"To do that it sends the package's ecosystem, name and version to the OSV database (api.osv.dev) and to the " +
	"package's public registry. It never sends file paths, repository names, your organization, your name, or the " +
	"names of packages from private registries. The services can see your IP address and the time of the check. " +
	"Separately, Observer downloads its signed lists of malicious and popular package names from superbased.app; " +
	"that download sends nothing about your packages. You can turn the online checks off at any time on the " +
	"Code security page (Package checks) or with the security.deps.online setting; Observer then uses its offline lists only."

// DisclosureTextManaged is the managed-node variant.
const DisclosureTextManaged = "Observer checks packages your AI agent tries to install, and the packages your projects use, " +
	"against vulnerability and malware data. To do that it sends the package's ecosystem, name and version to your " +
	"organization's server, which checks them on its own behalf (or against its own mirror). It never sends file " +
	"paths, repository names, your name, or the names of packages from private registries. Your organization " +
	"requires (or allows) this setting."
