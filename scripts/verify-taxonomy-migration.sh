# verify-taxonomy-migration.sh — assert the committed backfill migration
# internal/db/migrations/196_tooltax_action_type_backfill_2.sql matches a
# fresh run of internal/db/taxbackfillgen.
#
# taxbackfillgen is the SOLE writer of that file. It transposes
# internal/tooltax — the one Go owner of the cross-adapter tool/MCP
# taxonomy — into the historical-data repair the plan requires
# (docs/plans/tool-taxonomy-standardization-plan-2026-07-31.md §3:
# "sourced FROM the tooltax table at generation time, never
# hand-edited"). A hand-edit, or a tooltax row that moved without a
# matching `make taxonomy-migration-build`, is drift between the SQL and
# the taxonomy it claims to apply.
#
# Note the migration is APPLY-ONCE by nature: regenerating it after it
# has shipped changes bytes a user's database has already consumed
# (migrations are keyed by version, not by content). 077 shipped in v1.36.0
# and is FROZEN as shipped (released-step rule, D-880, T-982,
# docs/migration-numbering.md); 196 re-applies the full current table and
# is safe on a database that ran 077 (every statement only moves rows out of
# 'unknown'). Until the release that carries 196 is out, keep 196 in sync;
# after that, a tooltax change needs yet another NEW step (point
# taxbackfillgen's migrationName at it), never a regenerated 196. This gate
# and TestShippedMigrationsNeverChange both fail on a regenerated shipped
# step.
#
# Like verify-taxonomy-build.sh, this NEVER mutates the working tree and
# NEVER shells out to git: it regenerates into a scratch directory and
# byte-diffs against the committed file.
